# Chip-8 Emulator

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40keawade%2Fchip8-emu.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40keawade%2Fchip8-emu)

A TypeScript implementation of the [Chip-8 VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

This is just a packaged class implementing the Chip-8's processor, memory, and registers. Full emulation will require a clock, keypad, and monitor output. My own implementation of those features is being developed in TypeScript and React over at [chip8-web](https://gitlab.com/keawade/chip8-web).
